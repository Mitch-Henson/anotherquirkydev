# Things to see / do


- Free / tip-based walking tour starting at Brandenburg gate. Definitely recommend this the most. Best way to see all the main sights and give you an idea into the history (http://www.neweuropetours.eu/Berlin/en/home)
- Berliner Dome (7€). The coolest church with cartoon videos inside to tell you about the history of the church and religion. Really great views over Berlin
- Great Norwegian bar with shuffleboard Kaschk, near Rosa Luxemborg Platz.
- East side gallery. Famous part of the Berlin wall that is still standing which has artwork all over it
- Mauer Park on a Sunday. Biggest park and fleamarket in Berlin. Great place for shopping and eating food. Also music there and karaoke sometimes at 3pm in summer.
- Spy museum, Potsdamer Platz. Super cool history about spying and East vs West Germany and the tools that they used
- Concentration camp - Sachsenhausen. Very tough day trip but you get to pay your respects. Will take most of a day and you can do it through many tourist agencies.
